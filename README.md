# CellinoidModel
Cellinoid shape model for asteroids

In LightcurveVersion the main program is applied to search the best-fit rotational period, pole orientation, six semi-axes of cellinoid shape from lightcurves based on the Cellinoid shape and using the Lebedev techniques for accelerating the program. 

Please send me an email if you have downloaded this shape model and prepare to adopt it for some science objects.
